# Ruby Remembrance Lab

## Objectives

1. Use a class variable to keep track of every instance of a class that is created. 
2. Write a class method to access the list of all instances of a class, stored in a class variable. 

## Overview

The government has decided to start tracking every new puppy that is born, just like we track every new child who is born with a birth certificate. Because you're such a notoriously skilled programmer, you've been hired by the newly minted United States Department of Canines to write a program that will do just that. 

You need to write a program that stores each new puppy that is born. You will write a `Dog` class that initializes with a name and also stores each new instance of `Dog` that is instantiated.
